** TODO BEE
  * edits to writeup
  * DONE Calc #AI near each section
    - instead of looking at # of (non-almond) bee-attractive crops,
      look at how many different chemicals were used within 1-5
      buffers of almond sections.
  * see notes
  * TODO collect in-section, non-almond applications and analyze
  * TODO collect post 55degF applications within section & 1,3mi buff of
    bearing sections. Do this only for Central Valley Counties for
    temp reasons? This is going to entail using the boundaries
    schema... This might also be a good opportunity to explore the ddR
    package? Parallelizing will definitely help.
